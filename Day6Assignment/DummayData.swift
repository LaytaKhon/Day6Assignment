        In the opening chapter of Imogen Hermes Gowar’s first novel, “The Mermaid and Mrs. Hancock,” we meet a merchant in 18th-century London, Jonah Hancock, anxiously awaiting the ship full of trade goods that will cement his fortune. The somewhat timid Hancock wonders if he can now call himself a gentleman, without realizing that if you have to wonder, then you’re not. He “sees no benefit in questioning how things are, and avoids the society of what he calls ‘clever men.’” His chief measure of all things is money.
        
        Meanwhile, in a parallel story, a beautiful courtesan named Angelica Neal, penniless after the death of her aristocratic patron, has decided to abandon the protection of the madam whose top attraction she once was. Her bawd, Mrs. Chappell, is a gloriously grotesque “abbess” whose whores are “nuns” and whose “nunnery” is one of London’s most exclusive brothels. She’s the sort of buttery tyrant who chides her girls for not offering her a seat and orders one to recite a sonnet while another rubs her feet. As for Angelica, the question that comes to haunt her is: At the age of 27, am I over the hill
